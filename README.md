# System_Analysis_Project

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The client of this project is the the company DriverPass, a business that aims to help student drivers earn their driver's license through offering resources and
driving lessons. The client wanted a web-based application run on the cloud; students are registered through the secreatry adding them into the program's database
and lets students set their date, time, and driver based on availability.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I think overall, I understood what DriverPass wanted when thinking about the functional and nonfunctional requirements for the program. The interview made it clear what
the company owner wanted, and I was able to interpret that information enough to encapsulate what they wanted their program to do.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I think I could improve on my diagrams a large amount. While I knew how I wanted the classes to interact with each other, I felt I did not do enough justice in my diagrams
to show in an adewaute way how the program should be coded. I plan to improve how I make these diagrams in future projects.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I look at the users' needs by imagining the program from a use rperspective, essentially imagining I am using the program as if I had never seen it before. It's important
to consider user's needs when designing because the users are only going to see the completed program, and if the perspecive of a user browsing for the first time isn't
considered, the UI may be designed in a way that is not intuitive for the user.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I approach designing software by saying out loud how I would design a program. Typically I don't start designing with a complete plan, but I make improvements as I start
coding and testing. In the future, I think I would practice what I learned in this class to have designs ready.
